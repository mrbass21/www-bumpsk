This is a repository that will be incredibly uninteresting to pretty much anyone but me. It's a dumb simple site, for my dumb simple thoughts.

I wanted to have something somewhat minimalistic, and I love Swift, so I used Vapor. I also am not using OS X or Xcode for writing it.

I wanted to use my Windows system with Visual Studio Code Remote Tools to write it.

Yeah, you already regret reading this far.
